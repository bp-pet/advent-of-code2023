The code was written with the purpose of solving the problems as quickly as possible. In some cases this means that the readability is not that good. As the days went on, I figured out better ways to do things, so the format should be better (for example having a separate parser).

For a lot of problems some brainstorming and discussion was done with friends, most notably https://github.com/David-van-der-Linden. Other than that, the only outside help was used on day 24, and I'm still not happy with using a solver on it.
